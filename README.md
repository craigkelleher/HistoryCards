<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
This project is an online trading card game created with an education purpose. The chosen subject of this game is the Sengoku period of Japanese history, a tumultuous periuod of political upheaval and strife. 

As a software project, this game serves as a months-long exploration of the Unity game engine. It required my partner and I to learn the engine from the ground up. This involved learning Unity’s iterative visual workflow, scene management, C# scripting, asset creation and management, project collaboration, and deploying a build.

### Overview
* The game itself is an online browser-based game, heavily inspired by Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone.
* It is a single player card game, played against an A.I. opponent. 
* In addition to play mode, the project also contains a deck editor, collection viewer, and inventory system.
* The deck editor allows the player to edit and save their decks for future usage. 
* The collection viewer allows the player to view every card in the game and which cards they currently own. The inventory system allows the user to buy cards using points, which are earned by winning games. These cards can then be saved into decks and used in play mode.

### Main Features
 
* Users play head to head in a card game against a difficult scripted AI
* Users can use a premade deck, or edit a deck to their liking
* Users gain points from wins and can use points to buy more cards to add to a deck.
* Users can buy more cards and apply them to their deck within Collections
 
### Software and Languages
 
* Utilizes Unity WebGL
* C# for coding
* Unity takes C# and will compile it to run on a web plugin
* Python/MySQL for Database back-end
Estimated Minimum Requirements to Run Finished Game1:
* Updated Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

### Sources
 
* Using unity, we will use public domain images, fan-made art, and the unity art
package for trading card games and will be referencing each source. 
* DOTween (UnityAssetStore) to animate actions
* Card Design pack (UnityAssetStore)

<!-- Quality Attributes -->
## Quality Attributes
 
1. **Reliability** – For our team it is more important that features work predictably and reliably for our customers, so we started with a limited number of core features to make sure they were done right. In our testing of its reliability, our goal was to ensure for example if a user invoked a feature 10 times, that it would succeed 100% of the time.
2. **Testability** – Especially in the early days of this project’s development, we worked to ensure that features were easily testable and also thoroughly tested before being delivered to clients.
3. **Learnability** – We desire to have intuitive features and ease of navigation to increase customer retention. The site should be relatively simple to navigate, easily learned, and visual cues are to be plentiful.

### Known Bugs and Issues
 
* On certain systems, if the user gets clicks randomly on the screen in extremely quick succession, the application can fail.
 
### Product Backlog
 
* As a user I can click a tutorial and see graphically what to do in the game.
* As a user I can play against another human person
