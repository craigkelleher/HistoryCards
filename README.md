This project is an online trading card game created withh an education purpose. In gamifing the classroom, we hope to further engage students' interest in learning. To that end, the chosen subject of this game is theh Sengoku period of Japanese History, a tumultuous periuod of political upheaval and strife. 

The game itself is an online browser-based game, heavily inspired by Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone.

It is a single player card game, played against an A.I. opponent. In addition to play mode, the project also contains a deck editor, collection viewer, and inventory system.
The deck editor allows the player to edit and save their decks for future usage. The collection viewer allows the player to view every card in the game and which cards they currently own. The inventory system allows the user to buy cards using points, which are earned by winning games. These cards can then be saved into decks and used in play mode.

As a software project, this game serves as a months-long exploration of the Unity game engine. It required the team to learn the engine from the ground up. This involved learning Unityâ€™s iterative visual workflow, scene management, C# scripting, asset creation and management, project collaboration, and deploying a build. The process was challenging and the amount of information to learn daunting. But the team persevered and created a project in which we can take pride.

Our team aims to create a trading card game for an classroom education experience akin to
Hearthstone and Magic The Gathering. Our goal is to have a game that captures the
excitement and fun of a typical TCG game with elements to aid in the learning process for a
specific discipline while having fun. We will be doing this by utilizing the Unity game engine
and scripting in C#.

At project completion, students will be able to play with each other in a classroom tournament, allowing
them to earn points and coins, which they can spend acquiring more cards. The aim is to gamify
the classroom, hopefully engaging students more strongly in their education.

Game Requirements:
- Must be web-based
- Tournaments will have a title page, and the name of the current opponent.
- Students can use cards they have bought/earned to play an online TCG.
- Students can earn points from wins. Coins can be earned as well.
- Games end based on time or when one player wins.

Software & Languages:
- Unity WebGL
- C# for coding
- Unity takes our C# and will compile it to run on a web plugin
- Python/MySQL for Database back-end

Assets:
- DOTween (UnityAssetStore) to animate actions
- Card Design pack (UnityAssetStore)

Estimated Minimum Requirements to Run Finished Game1:
- Updated Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

Sources
- Using unity, we will use public domain images, fan-made art, and the unity art
package for trading card games and will be referencing each source.
